GoPro cameras have a time lapse setting which takes a series of still images which can then be converted into a time lapse video – here’s how to convert the images on a Linux box.

Install the tools
=================

Older distributions use “ffmpeg”, but newer Linux distros (such as Ubuntu 14.04) might call it “libav”.  This [blog post](http://blog.pkh.me/p/13-the-ffmpeg-libav-situation.html) explains why.  Anyway, figure out if you’re in the ffmpeg or libav camp and install the package. e.g.

```
sudo apt-get install libav-tools
```

Assemble the images
===================

ffmpeg (aka avconv) works well with image file names containing consecutive integers starting at 1. Let’s keep things simple and copy all the images we need into a temporary directory, renaming them in the process. For example:

```
TEMPDIR=temp
IMAGE_FILES="110GOPRO/G002*.JPG 111GOPRO/G002*.JPG"
i=1
for file in $IMAGE_FILES
do
  echo $file
  cp ${file} temp/$(printf "%05d.JPG" ${i})
  i=$((i+1))
done
```

Create the Video
================


Now it’s simply a matter of running ffmpeg, sorry “avconv”

```
avconv -f image2 -i temp/%05d.JPG output.mp4
```

or…

```
ffmpeg -f image2 -i temp/%05d.JPG output.mp4
```

Here’s one I made earlier:

The Wonders of avconv/ffmpeg
============================

avconv can also be used to convert between images formats, such as this example:

```
for file in *.MTS
do
  avconv -i $file -strict experimental ${file%.*}.mp4
done
```
