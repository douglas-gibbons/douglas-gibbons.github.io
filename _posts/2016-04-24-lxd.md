LXD is growing up, and with Ubuntu Xenial comes a number of changes.  Here’s how to get started with the new set-up.

Installing and Configuring LXD
==============================

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lxd
sudo lxd init
```

To enable local DNS resolution, create a file called /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d containing:

```
server=/lxd/<IP ADDRESS>
```

Where <IP ADDRESS> is the IP configured from the “lxd init” stage above.

Then restart network manager:

```
sudo  service NetworkManager restart
```

Either log off and log back on again or run this to add the lxd group to your user’s group set:

```
newgrp lxd
```

Creating a Container
====================

LXD offers the ability to import images and the like. You probably just want to get started, so let’s create an Ubuntu 16:04 container:

```
lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 my-xenial
```

This will download the image (if it hasn’t already) and create a container called “my-xenial”.

Running Commands on the Container
=================================

You can now run commands in that container, such as:

```
lxc exec my-xenial -- hostname
```

Or to open a bash prompt:

```
lxc exec my-xenial -- bash
```

Setting up SSH
==============

Unlike Docker, we have a full init system to play with, and the standard Ubuntu containers include a running ssh server.   Let’s make use of that and set up an SSH key to allow login from the host machine.

First push your SSH public key:

```
lxc file push ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub my-xenial/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys --mode=0600 --uid=1000
```

Now, because of the dnsmasq config we set up, you can use the hostname to SSH in:

```
ssh ubuntu@my-xenial.lxd
```

From here, you might want to play with [downloading, uploading and serving images](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/06/30/publishing-lxd-images/). Have fun!
