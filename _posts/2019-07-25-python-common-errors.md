Just a couple of common errors in Python, which are easily fixed

--------------

# NameError: name 'false' is not defined

Here's the error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'false' is not defined
```

In python, just write "__False__" rather than "false". It's a common slip of the keyboard.

# NameError: name 'true' is not defined

Again, the same for the "True" boolean value:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'true' is not defined
```

Just write "__True__" rather than "true"
