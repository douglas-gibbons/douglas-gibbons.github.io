## What is machine learning?

> "A learning machine is any device whose actions are influenced by past experience." - Nils John Nilsson

A machine learning system "learns" from existing data, either classifying the data itself (unsupervised learning), or learning to recognise classifications with pre-categorized data (supervised learning). The basic technique has been around for decades, however interest in the topic has mostly been academic until recently.

## Why the sudden interest?

Machine learning is computationally expensive; with the continual increase in computing performance, it is only now becoming possible to use the techniques in a commercially viable way.

## What's so special about machine learning?

> The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight." - Carly Fiorina

Here are some recent technological advances that use machine learning:

* Facebook automatically recognises individuals in images
* Autonomous vehicle technology, such as Tesla's "autopilot" system
* Analysing patient x-rays and providing more accurate medical diagnostics
* Reducing the number of spam emails
* Producing more accurate web search results
* Prevention and detection of credit card fraud

These types of problems are more challenging to solve with classic computational techniques, because there are so many dimensions to the problems.



## Do I need a lot of data, and what sort of data?

> "More data beats clever algorithms, but better data beats more data." - Peter Norvig

Here are some examples of data which might be suitable:

* Text, such as tweets, emails, or comment posts
* Images (and lots of them)
* Complex, multi-dimensional numeric data
* Audio files
* Anything that may have an affect on the outcome you wish to understand!

If a skilled individual can make accurate decisions, based on a set of data, then a computer should be able to match or better the accuracy of those decisions, based on the same set of data.


## How can machine learning benefit us?

> "I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail." - Abraham Maslow

Machine learning can be a bit like that. However, there are some tasks it excels at, some it will never be good at, and others where the technology is just not ready yet.
