Here are some course notes for getting started with Python. In this article,
we'll look at and run some code which has an example of ```if```,
```elif```, and ```else``` in it.

--------------

# Python if, elif and else

### if

The ```if``` statement can be used to ask a question, and ```if``` the answer is 
```True``` it will run the code block after it


### elif

```elif``` can be used after ```if```.  If the ```if``` question was ```False```
it will execute the code after ```elif``` if the ```elif``` question is ```True```.  It really means "else if", but that was too long for some lazy
programmers to type, so they use ```elif``` instead!

### else

```else``` can be used after an ```if``` statement, and sometimes after an ```elif```
statement. It executes the code after it, only if none of the previous questions
turned out to be ```True```


# Code Comments

It's helpful sometimes to add comments to your code, especially if it gets complicated!

Preceding some text in a python script with "#" stops the python program from 
treating it as python code - it just ignores it.  This means we can use "#" to 
write comments in our Python scripts to help others understand our code.


# The example code

```if```,```elif```,```else``` is best illustrated by example, so we have some code to try!

Click with the right mouse button on this link: <a href="/assets/python/if_elif_else.py">if_elif_else.py</a> and choose "save link as" or "save target as".

Can you save the code in a suitable directory, open a terminal window, navigate to the right directory, and run the code?


What does the code do?
