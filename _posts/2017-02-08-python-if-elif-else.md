Here are some course notes for getting started with Python. In this article,
we'll look at and run some code which has an example of '''if''',
'''elif''', and '''else''' in it.

--------------

# Python if, elif and else

### if

The '''if''' statement can be used to ask a question, and '''if''' the answer is 
'''True''' it will run the code after it


### elif

'''elif''' can be used after '''if'''.  If the '''if''' question was '''False'''
it will execute the code after '''elif''' if the '''elif''' question is '''True'''.

### else

'''else''' can be used after an '''if''' statement, and sometimes after an '''elif'''
statement. It executes the code after if, only if none of the previous questions
turned out to be '''True'''


# Code Comments

It's helpful sometimes to add comments to your code, especially if it gets complicated!

Preceding some text in a python script with "#" stops the python intepreter from 
treating it as python code - it just ignores it.  This means we can use "#" to 
write comments in our Python scripts to help others understand our code.


# The example code

if,elif,else is best illustrated by example, so we have such code.

Can you download <a href="/assets/python/if_elif_else.py">if_elif_else.py</a>,
save it, and run it?
