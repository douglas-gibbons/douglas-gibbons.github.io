"Webmaster", "DevOps", "Systems Engineer". These are just some of the job titles for engineers that keep the web running.  I am just one of those engineers.

In the past, I've also run teams of like-minded engineers and written software.  I also have an interest in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, as these technologies may well help to form our future for the better.
